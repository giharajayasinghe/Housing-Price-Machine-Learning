# Housing Price Prediction using Machine Learning

This project implements an end-to-end machine learning pipeline to predict
California housing prices using the Housing dataset by Aurélien Géron.

## Features
- Stratified train-test split
- Custom feature engineering
- Scikit-learn pipelines
- ColumnTransformer
- Linear Regression model
- RMSE evaluation

## Technologies Used
- Python
- NumPy
- Pandas
- Scikit-learn
- Matplotlib

## How to Run
1. Clone the repository
2. Open the notebook `housing_price_pipeline.ipynb`
3. Run all cells (dataset downloads automatically)

## Dataset
